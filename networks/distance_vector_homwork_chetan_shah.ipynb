    "# Distance-vector routing protocol\n",
    "A distance-vector routing protocol in data networks determines the best route for data packets based on distance. To establish the best route, routers regularly exchange information with neighboring routers, usually their routing table, hop count for a destination network and possibly other traffic related information. Routers that implement distance-vector protocol rely purely on the information provided to them by other routers, and do not assess the network topology. Distance-vector protocols update the routing tables of routers and determine the route on which a packet will be sent by the next hop which is the exit interface of the router and the IP address of the interface of the receiving router. Distance is a measure of the cost to reach a certain node. The least cost route between any two nodes is the route with minimum distance. \n"

    "## 1. Bellman–Ford algorithm\n",
    "The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The algorithm was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel in 1955, but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively. Edward F. Moore also published the same algorithm in 1957, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.\n",
